**FACT**: The majority of gym goers now workout with headphones on. I don’t think
it’s that most commercial gyms now only play top 40 hits, but that fact that
everybody has their own taste in music that pushes them to their max each and
everyday. For this reason I’m making this list / blog with a list of my top
played gym songs from my Gym iPod which I have had since 2010.

Sadly I don’t download a bunch of new music so don’t expect any new chart
toppers, but rather old school beats, sick rhymes and loud rock. If you aren’t a
fan of these genres find another blog to bash. I don’t stop you mid-set and
critique your choice of listening to classical Beethoven while your squatting
225lbs for max reps. So here it is, the contents from iTunes transferred from my
red iPod shuffle (that may explode if one more weight gets dropped on it). I
hope you can add a couple of these to your playlist and get as hyped as I do
