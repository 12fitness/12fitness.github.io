Today I am putting my clients through my own version of CrossFit's workout "**The Devils Mile**" It will test there cardiovascular endurance and will to succeed!

After the first group of clients did it this morning the time to beat is _29:46_.

A really good time would be sub _30 min_, but your average Joe should shoot for _35-40 min_. **Enjoy! :)**


## The Devils Mile 

These exercise are to be done in order for time:

1. _400 meters walking lunges_
2. _30 push ups_
3. _400 meters treadmill pushes_
4. _30 inverted rows_
5. _400 meters overhead farmers walk (45/25)_
6. _30 burpees_
7. _400 meters stair runs_
8. _30 full sit ups_


Afterwards most of my clients and people who tried the workout thought it was a great challenge, but the next day I was getting a lot of hate texts and complaints on how sore their legs were. So watch out it will creep up on you! 

Make sure to stretch and hydrate!
