## Nutrients

First and foremost, if you don't take in calories before you train, then your body is like a hybrid vehicle without gas; no matter how much you charge it with other forms of energy, you aren't going to go very far. Here is what you need before your workouts.

### Protein

Eat a whole food meal about 60-90min before training, then drink a pre workout shake as you head to the gym.The shake should have about 25-50g/protein depeding on how much you weigh. Research shows a mix of whey/casein is the best mix at this time.

### Carbs

Fast digesting carbs release insulin, driving the delivery of nutrients to muscle tissue. Take carbs in a 1:1 ratio with protein in your pre workout shake.

*On top of your regular diet these supplements will help you get to that next level with your training. Keep and eye out for these ingrediants the next time your at the supplement store.

## Strength Boosters

Boosting strength in the short term is possible with these three supplements. They are best in stand alone form, but can be found in a blended form.

Creatine
: Drives fluid into your muscle cells, blunting soreness and allowing you to lift heavier for longer. Creatine monohydrate is the standard truly tested brand standard.

Beta-Alanine
: This amino acid boosts muscular strength and endurance by increasing your body levels of carnosine, a small peptide formed of beta-alanine and histidine.

Cordyceps
: This tibetan fungus helps boost immediate strength by contributing to your ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) cycle. Combine creatine and cordyceps for greater immediate strength.

## Energy Boosters

Energy booster work in a wide variety of ways. Some stimulate your central nervous system (CNS) while others increase brain activity. Each of these forms of energy allows you to train harder and longer.

Caffenine Anhydrous
: Research shows that the dry form of this stimulant is the best for increasing energy and strength.

BCAA's
: This group of amino acids includes leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Branch chain Amino Acids are absorbed more readily into your system, bypassing the liver to go directly to working muscles, delivering fast energy.

Yohimbe
: As with caffeine, this extract from bark helps drive up energy levels by reducing stored body fat that you can use as energy.

## Pump Boosters

Muscle pumps provide more than an aesthetic improvement. A good pump delivers blood and nutrients to muscle tissue, helping it to recover, stretch and therefore grow.

Arginine
: This amino acid converts in your body to nitric oxide (NO), a gas molecule that allows your blood vessels to expand so that more blood, oxegyn and nutrients reach your working muscles.

Citrulline
: converts more naturally in your body to arginine therefore is more redily broken down. Research also shows that citrulline and arginine taken together is more effective at producing NO than taking either alone.

Agmatine Sulfate
: This relative new supplement supports nitric oxide synthase, the enzyme that helps produce NO from arginine.

## Fat Burners

Excess body fat isn't good for much but this: It's a great source of workout fuel. The key is getting your body to let go of the stored energy pre and post workout. The supplements below provide a 2 for 1. 

1. Helping fuel workouts, 
2. Burning your own fat. WIN/WIN!

Raspberry Ketones
: Rising in popularity since Dr. Oz showcased them a couple years back, these capsuls increase metabolic rate and release fat from storage.

Capsicum
: These chili pepper extracts drive up your metabolic rate so you can naturally burn more calories.

Green Coffee Bean Extract
: This bean contains a higher concentration of chlorogenic acid than do roasted beans. This is the chemical that works with caffeine to release and burn body fat.
