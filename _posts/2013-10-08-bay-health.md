Guys weight 135lbs,
Gals weight 95lbs.

Decided to do a team building WOD today that Rich Froning tweeted that he did. Was very tough as it is 32 reps with 5 second pauses. and 3, 12 second pauses in just under 4 minutes. Everybody did great! I'm a little rattled as I missed 2 reps so I will be doing it again to finish it!
