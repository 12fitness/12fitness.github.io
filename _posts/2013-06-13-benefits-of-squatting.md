**If, after this article, you still want to avoid getting in the rack and under the bar I consider you a lost cause. Enjoy!**

1. Increased Hormone Release – The Squat engages nearly every muscle in the body so it will activate the most hormone production of any exercise. Your testosterone and growth hormone levels will increase, speeding up your metabolism, burning more calories and creating more muscle mass.
2. Enhanced Core Strength – While performing a squat your core will be engaged and under tension the entire time. Your abdominals are performing an isometric hold to stabilize your entire body and prevent you from collapsing! Many people don’t think of engaging their abs while performing a squat, but they are a very important aspect of this lift and most other free-range exercises.
3. Improved Flexibility – While you are squatting you are stretching all the muscle fibers in your legs. Performing the eccentric motion (negative or downward motion) you are stretching and tearing your glutes, hamstrings, quads & hip flexors. Squatting past parallel is one of the most efficient stretches you can do.
4. Reduced Chance of Injury – Building muscles, improving core strength and becoming more flexible are all great ways to reduce your risk of injury. As you have read in the previous three points, the squat helps with all.
5. Improved Workout Efficiency – Why would you go into a gym and perform: leg curls, leg extensions, calf raises, good mornings, Romania dead lifts, hip add/abduction, leg add/abduction & glute bridges when you can get the benefits of all of these from squatting? Making your workouts more efficient is very important! Don’t waste your time in the gym - Get in, LIFT, and get out! 45min is all you need!
6. Develop Real World Strength – When is the last time you had to bench press something in the real world? So unless you’re an offensive linemen or a professional arm wrestler, LEG DAY should be the 1st day of your training split. How many times a day do you have to squat down or stand up to get something? A LOT!!! Squats are the most practical exercise you can do and will carry over many benefits into the every day life.
7. Sprint Faster – Studies show that performing explosive weighted squats twice a week will improve your 100m sprints by 8%. Activating your fast twitch muscle fibers can only mean one thing.
8. Increased Vertical Jump – The main jumping muscles are your hamstrings, calves and the arches on the bottom of your feet. The squat targets all of these! For faster results, add calf raises to the finish of your reps or progress to weighted squat jumps.
9. Improves Mobility & Balance – Free motion squats work every stabilizer muscle in your legs and many more throughout your body. Balance as an athlete is on of the most important and overlooked aspect of any game. Our core strength is always engaged while squatting.
10.  Tone the Posterior Legs – Everyone wants a sexy butt! Many people think running is the answer but who wants a flat bottom?! If that’s what you want, then go ahead, hop on a treadmill and run for an hour. If you would like a nice toned round butt then I will see you in the squat rack! Lots of people ask me “How do I get rid of the cellulite on the back of my legs?” You stretch and tear the muscles in the problem area stimulating them to break down the fat. So what exercise has the greatest hormone release again?!
11.  Cardiovascular Benefits – So you can go for a run or you can get under the bar and give me 5 sets of 20 reps. I already know which one burns more calories, but I will leave it up to you to decide which one works better…
12.  Functionality - You use your legs and feet everyday. I know you think your biceps look appealing, but strengthening your legs is much more practical!
