November 11th is fast approaching bringing us closer to another year of
"Murph."

This year we are going to be doing 4 versions of Murph, Scaled,
Intermediate & Advanced throughout different heats starting at 9am. The
4th version will be a community Murph where we can accumulate as many
reps and miles as possible during the day. (You could come and watch and
walk a mile or do a few pushups towards the total.)  

It will be $40 per person to take part and that will include a t shirt.
This event is open to non members of World Health at no extra charge. We
will be raising money for Canadian PTSD and taking Veterns Food Bank
donations at the door.
