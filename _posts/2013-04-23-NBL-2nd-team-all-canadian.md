A very big **CONGRATULATIONS** to my client and friend Doug McKinney who was just named an NBL 2nd Team All-Canadain for this past 2012/13 season. Doug put in a lot of hard work with me last year where he took his game to the next level! Very proud of him and I can assure you that he is not getting complacent for the upcoming season! There is a lot more work to be done!
