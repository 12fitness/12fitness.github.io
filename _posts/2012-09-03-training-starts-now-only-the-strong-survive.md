components of Fitness!

## 12 Components of Fitness

1. **Mindset**
   Is a lot of things to me and plays a key role in your success inside and
   outside of the gym. A lot of things go into making up your mindset, but this
   is what I boil it down to in a few key words: *Motivation*, *Commitment*,
   *Knowledge*, *Positivity*, *Embracing Adversity*, *Grit* & above all
   *Confidence*. When you have confidence you can have a lot of fun, and when
   you have fun, you can do amazing things!" - *Joe Namath*

2. **Nutrition**
   The key foundation to any successful athlete comes down to what is going into
   their body so they can perform at a top level. If we break it down to
   calories in and calories out food just becomes a fuel source to get you
   through your day. With my PrecisionÂ Nutrition guideline every client will get
   a meal plan, food log & supplement advice that will pave the way for your
   success\!

3. **Strength**

4. **Muscle Building**

5. **Gymnastics** 
   Push-ups, pull-ups, dips, pistol squats, handstand push-ups & walking to
   muscle-ups these are some of the main movements we will practice and make a
   fixture into your workout plan.

6. **Cardio**
   Plays a key part in almost every program. Acceptable forms of cardio include:
   running, swimming, rowing, skipping and almost any form of sport. Aerobic and
   Anaerobic activity is critical for blood pressure, heart rate, lung capacity,
   muscle building, fat loss and many more when done correctly.

7. **Mobility**
   Not your everyday yoga class. You will learn functional and practical
   mobility. Whether you are a professional athlete or somebody who sits at a
   desk all day, mobility plays a key role in keeping you in the game and
   healthy. I have saved people so much money from simple movements done daily
   to allow joints and muscles to move pain free through functional mobility.

8. **Agility**

9. **Power**

10. **Coordination**

11. **Athletics (sports)**

12. **Recovery**
